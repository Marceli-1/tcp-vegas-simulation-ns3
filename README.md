This repository contains an ns-3 simulation script to evaluate the performance of TCP Vegas under various alpha and beta parameters. The script tests combinations of alpha and beta values ranging from 1 to 10, along with different file sizes (5MB, 10MB, 100MB, 1000MB). Performance metrics such as throughput are logged for each combination to analyze the efficiency of TCP Vegas. To run the simulation, place the script in the scratch directory of ns-3, build it using waf, and execute the simulation. The fastest way to so setup ns-3 environment is by using docker image: https://github.com/hygorjardim/ns3-docker
